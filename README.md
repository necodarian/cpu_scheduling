# cpu_scheduling
write a computer program that implements the logic
behind the four essential CPU scheduling algorithms

Algorithms:
1. First In, First Out. FIFO
2. Shortest Job First. SJF
3. Priority Scheduling. PRI
4. Round Robin Scheduling. RR

Fallback algorithms:

1. If by any chance when scheduling Priority two or more processes are ready to be selected, scheduler
must fallback to FIFO.
2. If by any chance when scheduling Round Robin two or more processes are ready to be selected,
scheduler must fallback to SJF.
